This is my web-version of Spotify called JamUp.
It was my final project at IT school "IT-STEP".
I used HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node.js, express.
JamUp is not finished? because i had only 1.5 month, meanwhile i had my 11-th grade exams.
THere is a bug(project crushes when u try to switch song on the control panel at the bottom of a page)
